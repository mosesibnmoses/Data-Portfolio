# Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Moiseev 
Iâ€™m a Data Analyst with Expertise in Research Methodology and Statistical Insights across Public Health, Neuroscience, and Education. I have a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Psychology and Computer Science from the University of Oregon. Iâ€™m passionate about data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I enjoy working on projects that can make a positive impact on the world. Feel free to [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmoiseev/)!

## ðŸ“Š My Data Portfolio
This repository contains some of the projects that I have worked on or contributed to. These projects demonstrate my skills in data analysis and data visualization. You can find the code, data, and results for each project in the corresponding subfolder.

Here is a list of the projects that I have included in this portfolio (so far):

### [Bikeshare Trips Analysis](https://github.com/mosesibnmoses/Data-Portfolio/tree/main/Bike%20share%20business%20analysis)  **Python**/*Pandas* This project analyzes the last 12 months of Divvy Bikeshare trips in Chicago, focusing on the differences between casual users and paying members. 

I aim to showcase more type of projects here, as well as more of my skills. Meanwhile, here is also a couple of select publications I contributed to and used my data analysis and deep learning skills: 
### [**Automation of Quantifying Axonal Loss in Patients with Peripheral Neuropathies through Deep Learning Derived Muscle Fat Fraction**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmri.27508) *Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging* Â· Jan 14, 2022


In a recent publication, I introduced a deep learning-based approach for muscle segmentation from thigh and calf MRI images. I engineered a 3D U-net model and developed an ETL pipeline, which enabled the model to accurately segment individual muscles. Despite the limited training data available, I successfully implemented a data augmentation protocol. This allowed the 3D U-net model to be effectively trained and to yield valuable results on new images. These segmented muscles were subsequently used to evaluate the fat fraction. This is a significant contribution as muscle fat fraction serves as a reliable indicator of nerve degeneration, a key factor in monitoring the progression of neuropathic diseases. This method offers a more feasible alternative to direct nerve degeneration assessment, which is considerably more challenging.



### [**Morphometric Analysis of Peripheral Myelinated Nerve Fibers through Deep Learning**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jns.12293) *Journal of the Peripheral Nervous System* Â· Nov 28, 2018


In this project, I developed an automated method for extracting and evaluating morphometric data from mouse sciatic nerve semi-thin section images. My responsibilities included planning and designing the method, collecting hundreds of images, producing manual segmentations, and organizing the train and test datasets. I also wrote the code to process the images, implemented a U-net based deep learning system, and trained it. The paper evaluates the data acquired using this method by comparing the modelâ€™s segmentations to manual ones.
